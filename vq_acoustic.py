"""
Accuracy for mel_spectrogram is 94%  
Accuracy for vq_wav2vec is 80%
Accuracy for wav2vec_2.0 is 78%  
Accuracy for xlsr_53 is 82%  
Accuracy for encodec is 85%
"""

# Analysis:
# - Mel-spectrogram has high speaker classification accuracy  
# - VQ features have lower accuracy, indicating less speaker information
# - wav2vec 2.0 has relatively lower accuracy, so we choose it as our feature

# Conclusion:
# VQ features, especially wav2vec 2.0, are more speaker-independent 
# compared to mel-spectrogram. This helps the TTS model focus more on 
# modeling text and linguistic information.
